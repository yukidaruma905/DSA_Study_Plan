## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int n=5,m=5;

int main(){
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		for(int j=0;j<m;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```

In this code:

- The first line of the code sets the values of two integer variables `n` and `m` to `5` (where `n` represents the number of rows and `m` represents the number of columns).
- In the `main` function, there are two nested `for` loops. The outer loop `i` runs from `0` to `n-1` (`0` to `4`), and the inner loop `j` runs from `0` to `m-1` (`0` to `4`) for each iteration of the outer loop.
- Inside the inner loop, the statement `std::cout << "*";` prints an asterisk to the console.
- After the inner loop finishes executing, the statement `std::cout << std::endl;` prints a newline character, which causes the program to print a new line for the next iteration of the outer loop.
- This process repeats until both loops have finished executing, and a grid of asterisks `5` rows tall and `5` columns wide is printed to the console.
