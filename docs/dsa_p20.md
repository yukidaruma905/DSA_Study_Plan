## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int n=10;

int main(){
	for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++) {
		for(int j=0;j<=i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<((n/2)-1-i)*2;j++) {
			std::cout << " ";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<=i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}

/* -------------------------------- */

	for(int i=1;i<n/2;i++) {
		for(int j=0;j<(n/2)-i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<2*i;j++) {
			std::cout << " ";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<(n/2)-i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

In this code:

- The first line defines the variable `n` with the value `10`. This value determines the size of the diamond shape.
- The first half of the diamond shape is generated using the first loop:
	- The outer loop runs `n/2` times (in this case `5` times), with `i` ranging from (`0` to `n/2 -1`).
	- The first inner loop prints asterisks `i + 1` times, which is the number of asterisks in each line.
	- The second inner loop prints white spaces `((n/2) - 1 - i) * 2` times, which determines the distance between the two sets of asterisks.
	- The third inner loop prints asterisks `i + 1` times again to complete the diamond shape.
	- Finally, `std::endl` is used to insert a new line after each iteration of the outer loop.
- The second half of the diamond shape is generated using the second loop, which is similar to the first loop but with a few differences:
	- The outer loop runs `n/2 - 1` times (in this case `4` times), with `i` ranging from (`1` to `n/2 - 1`).
	- The first inner loop prints asterisks `(n/2) - i` times, which is the number of asterisks in each line.
	- The second inner loop prints white spaces `2 * i` times, which determines the distance between the two sets of asterisks.
	- The third inner loop prints asterisks `(n/2) - i` times again to complete the diamond shape.
	- Finally, `std::endl` is used to insert a new line after each iteration of the outer loop.
