## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int n=4,m=7;

int main(){
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		for(int j=0;j<(m-2*i-1)/2;j++) {
			std::cout << " ";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<i+1;j++) {
			std::cout << (char)('A' + j);
		}
		
		for(int j=i;j>0;j--) {
			std::cout << (char)('A' + j-1);
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
   A
  ABA
 ABCBA
ABCDCBA
```

In this code:

- First, we define two variables `n` and `m`, with the values `4` and `7` respectively.
	- `n` is used to control the number of rows in the pyramid shape.
	- `m` is used to determine the width of each row.
- In the `main` function, we have a `for` loop `i` runs from (`0` to `n-1`), this will handle the height of the pattern.
	- Inside, we have the first inner loop `j` runs from (`0` to `(m-2*i-1)/2`) that will print spaces `" "` before the letters in each row.
		- The number of spaces printed will be determined by the expression `(m-2*i-1)/2`, which calculates the number of spaces required for each row.
	- After printing the spaces, another for loop `j` runs from (`0` to `i+1`) is used to print the letters, where `j` is the current letter.
		- The letters will start from `'A'` and increase by one for each subsequent letter in the same row.
	- Finally, another for loop `j` runs from (`i` to `1`) is used to print the decreasing letters, which form the right half of the pyramid shape.
		- The letters will start from the last letter in the previous loop and decrease by one for each subsequent letter in the same row.
- The loop continues to run until all `n` iterations are completed.
