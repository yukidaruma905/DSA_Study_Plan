## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int n=4;

int main(){
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
		for(int j=0;j<n;j++) {
			if(j<=i) {
				std::cout << j+1;
			}
			else {
				std::cout << " ";
			}
		}
		
		for(int j=n-1;j>=0;j--) {
			if(j<=i) {
				std::cout << j+1;
			}
			else {
				std::cout << " ";
			}
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1      1
12    21
123  321
12344321
```

In this code:

- This is a pattern of two triangles, with one being a right-triangle and the other being a mirror image (a left-triangle). The spaces are used to maintain the triangle shape, making the pattern symmetrical.
- The first line of code sets the value of an integer variable `n` to `5` (where `n` is the number of rows for the two triangles).
- In the `main` function, we have a `for` loop that runs `n` times. For each iteration of this loop, the following happens:
	- We have an inner `for` loop that runs `n` times. This loop is used to print the first triangle.
		- Within this inner loop, there is an `if` statement that checks if the value of `j` is less than or equal to `i`.
		- If it is, the value of `j+1` is printed.
		- If not, a space character `" "` is printed.
	- The second `for` inner loop runs `n` times in reverse order. This loop is used to print the second triangle.
		- Within this inner loop, there is an `if` statement that checks if the value of `j` is less than or equal to `i`.
		- If it is, the value of `j+1` is printed.
		- If not, a space character `" "` is printed.
	- Finally, after the second inner loop, a newline character `std::endl` is printed to move to the next row.
- The loop continues to run until all `n` iterations are completed.
