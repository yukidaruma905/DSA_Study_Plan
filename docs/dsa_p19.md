## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int n=10;

int main(){
	for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++) {
		for(int j=0;j<(n/2)-i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<2*i;j++) {
			std::cout << " ";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<(n/2)-i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}

/* ---------------------------- */

	for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++) {
		for(int j=0;j<=i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<((n/2)-1-i)*2;j++) {
			std::cout << " ";
		}
		
		for(int j=0;j<=i;j++) {
			std::cout << "*";
		}
		std::cout << std::endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

In this code:

- The first line defines the variable `n` with the value `10`. This value determines the size of the diamond shape.
- In the `main` function, the first `for` loop runs `n/2` times, which is `5` times in this case, in each iteration, there are three parts of the output:
	- The first part is a sequence of asterisks. This part is determined by the inner `for` loop that runs `(n/2) - i` times.
	- The second part is a sequence of spaces. This part is determined by the second inner `for` loop that runs `2 * i` times.
	- The third part is also a sequence of asterisks. It is similar to the first part.
- The second half of the diamond is printed by the second `for` loop. This loop runs `n/2` times, which is `5` times in this case, in each iteration, there are three parts of the output:
	- The first part is a sequence of asterisks. This part is determined by the inner `for` loop that runs `i + 1` times.
	- The second part is a sequence of spaces. This part is determined by the second inner `for` loop that `((n/2) - 1 - i) * 2` times.
	- The third part is also a sequence of asterisks. It is similar to the first part.
